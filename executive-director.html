                    Stan Zegel is a founder of the Citizen Participation Institute, and its Executive Director,
                    concentrating on long-range strategies, fundraising, and recruitment of board members for advice,
                    direction, and to assure the continuation of the Institute's mission.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mr. Zegel has been active for over 30 years in advancing civic health, including founding community
                    weekly newspapers distributed to all households in town the day before each city or village board
                    meeting so the public there could know what was being proposed while they still had time to
                    influence the outcome. He is a founder of the Citizen Participation Institute.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He has been the initiator of seven successful referenda on questions of public policy since 1985,
                    including one on retaining, not abolishing, the police department in his community. In 2013 his work
                    was recognized with a coveted Citizen Initiative Award from a regional good-government organization,
                    one of only two awarded that year.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Stan Zegel is a former elected village trustee, and has recruited local nonpartisan candidates in
                    his community for many years so that voters will have a choice. The experience has revealed how
                    wide-spread the problem is of voters being unable to have a choice because there is only one
                    candidate. He initiated a candidate fair, and published a directory of available elective offices,
                    projects now being embraced and expanded by the Citizen Participation Institute.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He founded a firm in 1970 that grew to handle the voter registration records processing for half the
                    counties in Iowa. He performed original codification and published each year an annotated version of
                    the Iowa election laws for his clients, who were the local election administrators. He also was
                    their lobbyist for simplification and reform, and wrote the major changes to the Iowa election
                    statutes for several years.

                </p>

                <p>
                    He continued his editing of helpful legal materials, as the organizer and lead analyst at another
                    organization for a pilot project to collect, organize, and index unpublished legal precedents
                    involving those good government laws. It is now being continued on an enlarged and improved basis by
                    this Citizen Participation Institute and results will be published and updated frequently.
