                    Shannon Malone Burns is a founder of the Citizen Participation Institute.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dr. Burns believes that a strong local government is critical to America’s success as a democracy.
                    To that end, she values bi-partisan efforts that work toward fair and ethical governing bodies at
                    the local level..
                </p>

                <p>
                    ​A life-long community activist, Dr. Burns’ professional career began as a crisis interventionist
                    working with Vietnam Veterans in Will County, Illinois. Her work lead to a national position in
                    community outreach and program development for addicted adolescents. In 1991, She founded Peaceful
                    Heart Therapies and has been providing wellness services to private clients and consulting services
                    to small business for over 25 years. Dr. Burns also provides consulting and training to individuals,
                    small businesses and professional associations on personal and business ethics, using an
                    award-winning model that she developed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout her career, Dr. Burns has been involved in helping community groups find solutions to
                    challenges that impact special need populations and community life. In 1978 she helped found
                    Sheltering Arms, the first women’s halfway house in Illinois and was instrumental in establishing a
                    statewide credentialing program for prevention professionals. To raise awareness of the need for
                    safe bicycling trails across Illinois, Dr. Burns bicycled solo from Downers Grove to Springfield in
                    1984.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2015, Dr. Burns lead a successful effort to keep forest preserves in DuPage County separate from
                    county government. Offering voters an actual choice in an environment where one political party is
                    dominent, in 2010, she ran for elected office in a bid to become the first Democrat elected to the
                    Forest Preserve District of DuPage County. Unsuccessful in 2010, she won the seat in 2012 and served
                    two years as the District 6 representative on the Forest Preserve’s Board of Commissioners.

                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to her Bachelor of Arts degree in Social Work/Community Organization, Master’s Degree in
                    Business Administration and Doctorate in Adult Education, Dr. Burns is a Certified Woodland Steward
                    and active volunteer at the Morton Arboretum, the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County and the
                    Conservation Foundation. She currently serves on the board of the Wheaton League of Women Voters as
                    well as on the Plan Commission in Warrenville, Illinois.
