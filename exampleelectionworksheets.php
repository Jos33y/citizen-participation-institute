                <h4>The Competitiveness Spreadsheet</h4>
                <p>There is one of these spreadsheets for each of the eight counties for the local elections of 2013 and
                    2015.</p>

                <p>All the possible elective offices are listed, by public body. Using data available on line, you will
                    enter the number of seats available then, and the number of candidates for those seats. The
                    spreadsheet will calculate the amount of choice a voter had in that race.
                </p>
                <p> This information is important to establish the base line of how easy it is for a candidate to win if
                    he
                    runs. After we do our educational outreach to get more people interested in running, we will be able
                    to
                    see if were successful in increasing voter choice in various races.

                <h4>The Electoral History Spreadsheet</h4>
                <p>We will need one of these spreadsheets for each of the 1,300 public bodies expected to have
                    candidates on the April 2017 ballot.</p>

                <p>The bottom portion of the spreadsheet receives data you input; the top portion is all calculated
                    automatically.
                </p>

                <p> The bottom portion shows, for each two-year election cycle back to 2003, how many votes were cast,
                    and who won each seat on the ballot. Because terms are staggered for some offices, some columns span
                    different rows. (The figures between the quantity of votes cast, and the names, are automatically
                    calculated based upon the votes cast.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    This worksheet calculates whose terms are due to expire (something the public bodies themselves
                    sometimes lose track of). Information from each worksheet will be the used to build the directory of
                    available seats up for election that we will publish in hopes of attracting more persons to become
                    candidates.
